## Description and Scope Focus

We plan on building a web application which will allow users to stream what they are doing on their computer to other users. Additionally, Streamers will receive notifications when new users join their stream and begin watching. Viewers will be able to send emoji reactions that other viewers and the streamer can view. The scope of this assignment will mainly be focused on the backend, implementing the pushdown notifications, emoji reactions, and peer-to-peer connections. Although the frontend will also require lots of work to display the stream, allow users to join streams, and show emoji reactions.

## Complexity Points to Achieve

3pts: Implementation of Pushdown notifications for when new users join a stream.  
1pt: The use of Peer.js, which we will use for streaming.  
1pt: For the use of screen capture API.  
2pts: The use of socket.io, which we will use for initializing the peer connection and emoji reactions.
